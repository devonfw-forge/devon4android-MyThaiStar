# My Thai Star
Devonfw reference application for Android

## Configure API key

Get an [API key](https://github.com/devonfw-forge/devon4android-MyThaiStar/blob/develop/documentation/apikey.md#api-key).

Go to your .gradle folder in your home directory.
- on Windows: `C:\Users\<Your Username>\.gradle`
- on Mac: `/Users/<Your Username>/.gradle`
- on Linux: `/home/<Your Username>/.gradle`

Now open the gradle.properties file.
If there isn't any just create it.

After that add the following key to the file as a property: `MyThaiStar_Geo_ApiKey`.

Then add a valid key value to your key, e.g. `my-valid-api-key-value`.

Your property could look like this:

```
MyThaiStar_Geo_ApiKey = "my-valid-api-key-value"
```
